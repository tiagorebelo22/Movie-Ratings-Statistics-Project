https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tiago.rebelo/viz/Movies_Statistics_Project/Dashboard1

An interactive Tableau dashboard that enables a comprehensive statistical analysis of movie ratings. The data was collected using web scraping techniques and analysed focusing on several key aspects:

1\. Movie Genres vs. Ratings:\
We investigated whether movie genres have an influence on ratings through the application of an ANOVA test. This analysis allowed us to determine if there are significant variations in ratings across different genres.

2\. Budget vs. Ratings:\
We examined whether there is a correlation between movie budgets and ratings by employing an independent samples t-test. This analysis aimed to uncover any potential association between the financial investment in a movie and its resulting ratings.

3\. Ratings vs. Revenues:\
We assessed whether ratings have an impact on movie revenues using an independent samples t-test. By analysing the relationship between ratings and revenues, we aimed to discern if higher ratings are linked to greater financial success.

4\. User Ratings vs. Critic Ratings:\
We explored the presence of a correlation between user ratings and critic ratings using the Pearson correlation score. This analysis aimed to identify any alignment or disparity between the opinions of moviegoers and professional critics.

In summary, this project not only provided valuable insights into movie ratings but also shed light on the relationships between movie genres, budgets, revenues, and different types of ratings. By employing various statistical techniques, we were able to draw meaningful conclusions and contribute to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing movie ratings.
